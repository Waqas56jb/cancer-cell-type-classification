# cancer-cell-type-classification
This project uses deep learning to classify different types of cancer cells from microscopic images. A CNN-based model is trained on labeled image data to accurately detect cell types. It helps in early diagnosis and supports medical research in oncology. The system is built using Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and OpenCV for preprocessing.
